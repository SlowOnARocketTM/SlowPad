# SlowPad
My Sumbmition to the HackClub Blueprint!
## My Goal
When I started making the SlowPad, I had a goal in mind. I wanted a macro pad that could be versatile. I wanted to be able to switch the macro depending on what I was doing and while it may seem like an easy thing to make, 
I never made anything using **Fusion** and **KiCad**. Since this is my first time using hardware and software together i'm actually quite happy of the result!
